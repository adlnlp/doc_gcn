## Node Feature Extractors
Our DocGCN proposed four aspect features for Layout Analaysing. In this directory, we provide the code for extracting density and syntactic features. For apprearance and semantic feature, we provide an example on FUNSD dataset to show how to extract via google colab notebook directly. We also provide the notebooks for extracting [apprearance]() and [semantic]() features seperately.
